Tech Thinker. <a href="http://www.nuecho.com">Nu Echo</a> Co-Founder.<br/> 
Speech Recognition &amp; Telephony Industry.

Hike. Code. Read. Build. Garden.

I’m an entrepreneur with some vision for the future. I like to tackle, mash and hack 
lots of new and interesting technologies. For more then 10 years, I’ve been 
specializing in speech recognition and telephony but I have vast interest in 
other building blocks such a web, cloud-computing, automation, linguistics, 
jvm languages, Linux, and such. I love to create new and innovative things. 
I tend to stay on the pragmatic side of things and I get shit done.

I also happen to love sharing my ideas. That’s why this space exists.
