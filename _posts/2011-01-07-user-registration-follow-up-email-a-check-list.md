Congratulation! You have a new registered user! Now what?

[SaaS][1] (or any other application form as a matter of fact) generally requires to send the new 
user some sort of welcome message or registration follow-up email. If that’s not your case, 
think about it. While sometimes neglected, this very first message could end up being the 
**utmost important customer communication message**. Its sole objective is to jump-start 
a long term relationship with your user.

I’m far from being a communication or marketing guru such as [Seth Godin][2] or fellow Montrealer [Mitch Joel][3]. 
But I listen and learn. This check list is a result of several iterations mostly based on a mix of subjective 
criteria, feedback from users, and some [information][4] [collected][5] [over][6] the years. Some items might generally 
apply to any form of email communication. Your mileage may vary. Feel free to share, comment or question.

## **Subject**

Be clear about the purpose of your email message. While just *“Account Registration”* does not cut it, something 
like “*Your XYZ Service Account Registration Details*” or event better yet “*Welcome to XYZ Service!*” does it. 
Simple, yet efficient.

## **Sender**

Like any other email communications, your Reply-To field should [always be a valid email address][7] 
even if automated. Why? To **keep the communication flowing**. Either invite the user to reply 
back for any questions or other information requests. This Reply-To could be either one of the 
founder, product manager, or even a [CRM][8] or [Ticketing System][9]. Something like *product-xyz-noreply@foo.bar* 
is simply unthinkable or crudely put: irresponsible. You’re a user yourself, [not a program][10].

## **Recipient**

During the registration process, you have most probably asked for a firstname, lastname combo. Then use it! Add a 
touch of personalization to your email communications. Start your content with “*Dear John Smith,*” or 
simply “John,” depending on your corporate style, audience, or communication guide (eurhm right).

## **Introduction**

First and foremost, your message should [remind your user what this message is all about][11]. Some 
user receives lots of registration emails, and it might be hard to keep track of everything. 
Simplify the process by explicitly stating the purpose of your sending. “*This is a follow-up message 
regarding your recent XYZ service registration.*” would do the trick or its minimalist 
counterpart “*Your XYZ service account is now ready!*”

## **Body**

Keep the body short but always useful. Depending on your style, you might even add a funny touch, 
similar to folks at [CD Baby][12].

### *How to get started.*

Provide the user with some hints about what can be done next or some other form of inspiration 
regarding your service.

### *How to get help.*

Provide information about how a user can find help. This could be a link over your online forum, 
your [Get Statisfaction][13] channel, an [IRC web chat room][14], or simply a reminder about your 
support team contact details.

### *How to cancel.*

It’s always nice to let the user know that she has (and will always have) a way out.

## **Conclusion**

A conclusion is a way to wrap things up and **open up for more**. Remind the user that he may hit the reply 
button to ask for help. You might even try **up-sale some of your complementary services** if applicable. 
In fact, you should. If a user is favorable to one of your service, she might also be interested in some 
other proposition that you have.

## **Signature**

Always sign your email. Personally. This could be just you, your team or the whole company.

> ***This is your first customer communication email. Don’t make it your last one!***

## **A few last notes**

*   Always keep in mind your target audience.
*   If using a HTML template (which I would highly recommend), provide an alternate ASCII text content as well.
