Abstract:

> Was your blog ever brought to its knees by a sudden spike in traffic following a 
> link from a high profile site’s front page or an infinite chain of tweets? Well, 
> mine did, and it failed miserably as would any WordPress installation using the default 
> configuration and infrastructure.

<!-- more --> 

> This talk will start with high-level optimization rules of thumb and common WordPress 
> performance bottlenecks then tackle various optimization strategies, from simple Apache 
> configuration tweaks and specialized WordPress plugins, to content distribution mechanisms 
> and reverse proxy techniques such as nginx. Let me share some of my actionable tricks 
> along with some benchmark data to compare the alternatives. Let’s boost your blog together.
